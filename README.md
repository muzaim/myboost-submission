## Project Overview
The Magazine App is a digital platform designed to make it easy for users to read and manage articles in one place. On the main page, users can explore a collection of articles that include the title, author, summary, and cover image. Each article can be opened to view its full content, giving readers a seamless way to access information.

In addition to browsing, the app also provides a feature to create new articles. Through a simple form, users can enter essential details such as the title, author, summary, category, location, content, and cover image. This makes it possible for anyone to contribute new content, ensuring that the magazine continues to grow and stay updated.
